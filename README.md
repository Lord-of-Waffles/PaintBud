## What is PaintBud?

### PaintBud is my final project for a Back-End programming course at university
- The site is designed for miniature hobbyists to be able to track which paints they are using for each project
- PaintBud supports nearly the entire Citadel paint range, excluding Air paints.
- PaintBud also includes random palette generator if you can't decide on a paint scheme

## PaintBud is written in Kotlin, and uses the Ktor framework.
- It uses Thymeleaf for templating, Bulma for styling and Firebase for storing data

## It's alive!
- PaintBud is live right now at: https://paintbud-a6edfd9853fe.herokuapp.com/
